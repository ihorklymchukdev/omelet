"""What the frozen builds are allowed to contain.

The API ships as a Docker image the VM pulls and the rest of the runtime is
fetched by the VM itself; neither is ever frozen into the host binary. Nothing
enforced that except the import-boundary test, which says nothing about
`datas` -- and `datas` is how two host-side compose files came to sit under
`agent/` and get bundled from there.

Every spec is checked, not just the one whose platform someone is on: a mac
build that bundles the wrong thing is invisible from Windows and the other way
round.
