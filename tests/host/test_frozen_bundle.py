"""What the frozen builds are allowed to contain.

The agent ships as a Docker image the VM pulls and the engine is fetched by the
VM itself; neither is ever frozen into the host binary. Nothing enforced that
except the import-boundary test, which says nothing about `datas` -- and `datas`
is how two host-side compose files came to sit under `agent/` and get bundled
from there.

Every spec is checked, not just the one whose platform someone is on: a mac
build that bundles the wrong thing is invisible from Windows and the other way
round.
