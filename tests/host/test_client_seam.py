"""The host client driven against the real agent app.

The fake-opener tests in `test_client.py` assert the requests the client builds;
this file proves those requests are the ones the agent actually serves. A route
renamed, a verb changed, or an error body reshaped fails here rather than on a
real VM. Nothing spawns a process or opens a socket: the app runs in-process
behind an opener adapter, over a fake Docker runner.
