"""The installer's smoke test, driven against the real agent app.

`verify_step` is the last thing setup does before it tells a non-technical user
everything works, so it is worth proving through the whole seam rather than
against a stub client: the project is created, uploaded, started and torn down
over HTTP, by the same routes a real VM serves. Nothing spawns a process, a
container or a socket -- the app runs in-process over a fake Docker runner.
