# Design boards

`omelet-web-ui.dc.html` is a snapshot of `Omelet Web UI.dc.html` from the
claude.ai/design project `5a77e605-5a2a-4a68-a1e7-76c07c0d8aa2`, taken
2026-09-22. The project stays the source of truth; refresh this copy when the
board changes. It will not render on its own (it expects the design tool's
`support.js` runtime) — read it as markup: tokens are in the `<style>` block at
the top, and every frame is a plain inline-styled `<div>`.

What the board shows but the product does not do is listed in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-web-ui-agent-prerequisites-design.md`,
section 1 ("Scope cuts"); what each part inherits from the agent is in
section 8.
