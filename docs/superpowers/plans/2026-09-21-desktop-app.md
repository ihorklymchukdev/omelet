# Omelet Desktop App Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace the tkinter `host/setup_app/` with a pywebview desktop app that renders the Omelet Desktop design board on Windows and macOS.

**Architecture:** A native window hosting local HTML/CSS/JS over the system webview (WebView2 / WKWebView). `host/desktop/api.py` is the only object JavaScript can reach; slow work runs on worker threads registered in `host/desktop/jobs.py` and pushes events back with `evaluate_js`. All branching logic lives in `host/desktop/view.py`, which is pure and therefore the only part with tests. `host/core/**` is called as-is.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12+, pywebview (+ `pythonnet` on Windows, `pyobjc` on macOS), stdlib `threading`/`webbrowser`, vanilla JS, PyInstaller.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-desktop-app-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- **`host/` never imports `agent/`.** Enforced by `tests/host/test_no_agent_import.py`.
- **No `sys.platform`, `platform.system()` or `os.name` outside `host/providers/`.** Enforced by `tests/test_no_platform_leak.py`, which globs `host/**/*.py` and will cover `host/desktop/` automatically. Resolving frozen asset paths uses `getattr(sys, "_MEIPASS", None)` — an attribute check, not a platform check, and permitted.
- **The host declares no YAML parser and no web framework.** `tests/host/test_host_dependencies.py` forbids `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pyyaml`.
- **Python 3.12+, `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module, frozen dataclasses for value types.**
- **No copy in Python.** All user-facing words live in `host/desktop/ui/index.html`, taken verbatim from the design board. `view.py` returns state identifiers and facts only.
- **No remote URLs in `host/desktop/ui/`.** Fonts are bundled woff2. Enforced by a test added in Task 5.
- **Agent/edge ports** are `constants.AGENT_PORT = 39099` and `constants.EDGE_PORT = 39080`. Never hard-code either.
- **Run tests with a writable TMPDIR in this sandbox:** `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest -q`. `/tmp/pytest-of-$USER` is root-owned here and breaks `tmp_path`.
- **Commit after every task.** Branch is `feature/desktop-app`, cut from `main`.

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `host/desktop/view.py` | Pure mapping: `Readiness` → route, step list → row model, terminal exception → event, folder → summary. All branching, all tests. |
| `host/desktop/jobs.py` | One-at-a-time worker-thread registry; coalesces progress events. |
| `host/desktop/api.py` | `DesktopApi` — the fixed surface JS may call. Thin: delegates to `host/core` and `view.py`. |
| `host/desktop/__main__.py` | Entrypoint: provider, window, `webview.start()`, WebView2-missing fallback. |
| `host/desktop/ui/index.html` | Every screen as a `<template>`; all copy; CSP. |
| `host/desktop/ui/app.css` | The board's tokens verbatim + focus states + reduced-motion. |
| `host/desktop/ui/app.js` | Router and renderers. No framework. |
| `host/desktop/ui/fonts/` | Bricolage Grotesque, Hanken Grotesk, IBM Plex Mono woff2 + OFL licenses. |

Modified: `host/client.py` (upload progress), `host/core/provider.py` + `host/providers/wsl2.py` + `host/providers/lima.py` (`reboot()`), `host/cli.py` (entrypoint swap, `up` guard), `pyproject.toml`, both packaging specs, `CLAUDE.md`.

Deleted: `host/setup_app/**`, `tests/host/test_setup_app_logic.py`.

# Milestone 1 — Shell, bridge, Home

Deliverable: the app opens, probes the machine, and shows the correct one of the four Home states or the unreachable screen. No install yet.

### Task 1: Readiness → route

**Files:**
- Create: `host/desktop/__init__.py` (empty), `host/desktop/view.py`
- Test: `tests/host/desktop/__init__.py` (empty), `tests/host/desktop/test_view_route.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `host.core.status.Readiness`, `host.core.constants.SUPPORTED_API`
- Produces: `route_for(readiness: Readiness) -> tuple[str, str]` returning `(route, state)` where route is `"home"` or `"unreachable"` and state is one of `"not_installed"`, `"stopped"`, `"wrong"`, `"running"`, or `""` for `unreachable`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/host/desktop/test_view_route.py
"""Which screen a probe result opens.

`probe()` returns early at every stage, so each Readiness shape below is
exactly one `return` in host/core/status.py. The rows are mutually exclusive;
getting one wrong shows the user a screen whose words are false.

### Task 2: Job registry

**Files:**
- Create: `host/desktop/jobs.py`
- Test: `tests/host/desktop/test_jobs.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from earlier tasks.
- Produces:
  - `class JobBusy(RuntimeError)`
  - `class JobRegistry` with `__init__(self, push, *, clock=time.monotonic, min_interval=0.1)`, `start(self, kind: str, work) -> str`, `join(self, timeout=None) -> None`.
  - `work` is called as `work(emit)` where `emit(event: dict) -> None`. The registry adds `job` and `kind` keys to every event before pushing. Events with `{"type": "progress"}` are coalesced to at most one per `min_interval`; every other type passes through immediately.
  - `work` returning a dict pushes it as the terminal event; `work` raising pushes `{"type": "crashed", "message": str(exc)}`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/host/desktop/test_jobs.py
"""The worker-thread registry behind every slow button.

Two things here can lose data rather than merely misbehave: a progress
coalescer that drops the *last* event (leaving a bar stuck at 96% forever),

### Task 5: The UI shell — tokens, fonts, Home and first run

**Files:**
- Create: `host/desktop/ui/app.css`, `host/desktop/ui/app.js`, `host/desktop/ui/fonts/*.woff2`, `host/desktop/ui/fonts/OFL.txt`
- Modify: `host/desktop/ui/index.html`
- Test: `tests/host/desktop/test_ui_assets.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `DesktopApi.home()`, `DesktopApi.open_omelet()` (Task 3).
- Produces: `window.omelet.on(event)` — the global the Python `push` calls; `data-screen` attributes on each `<template>` naming a route+state pair.

```

Each Home template's `<footer class="odds">` carries the board's "Odds and ends" grid — five tiles plus the version line. Copy verbatim, with the two tiles that need a VM disabled in the `not_installed` state exactly as the board shows them:

```html
<footer class="odds">
  <span class="overline">Odds and ends</span>
  <div class="tiles">
    <button data-action="import">Import folder</button>
    <button data-action="ports">Ports</button>
    <button data-action="doctor">Doctor</button>
    <button data-action="check-updates">Check for updates</button>
    <button class="tile-danger" data-action="uninstall">Uninstall</button>
    <span class="tile-note"><span data-field="app_version"></span> · <span data-field="engine_version"></span></span>
  </div>
</footer>
```

```html
<template data-screen="updates-unavailable">
  <section class="pad centered">
    <h2 class="title">Nothing to check yet</h2>
    <p class="lede">Omelet updates itself when a new version is released.
      There's nothing to check for yet.</p>
    <p class="hint"><span data-field="app_version"></span> ·
      <span data-field="engine_version"></span></p>
    <div class="row"><button class="btn-secondary" data-action="go-home">Done</button></div>
  </section>
</template>
```

```js
// Ships visible and honest rather than hidden: the board has the tile, and
// there is no update backend behind it yet.
ACTIONS['check-updates'] = async () => show('updates-unavailable', await api().home());
ACTIONS['uninstall'] = () => show('uninstall-confirm', {});
```

Layout classes (`.pad`, `.display`, `.lede`, `.steps`, `.row`, `.hint`, `.badge*`, `.odds`, `.tiles`, `.log`) are styled in `app.css` using the board's exact type sizes from the token sheet: Display 42/800 Bricolage, Title 31, Body 16.5, Label 14.5, Overline 12 at +.1em, Mono 13. Window padding 40/48, card padding 16–22, gaps 10–14 within a group and 22–28 between groups.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest tests/host/desktop/ -q`
Expected: PASS — all of Milestone 1's tests

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the window actually opens**

Run: `python3 -m host.desktop` on a machine with a webview. Expected: an 880×620 window showing one of the Home states, following the OS light/dark setting. This cannot be verified from the WSL dev shell — record it as done on Windows or macOS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add host/desktop/ui tests/host/desktop/test_ui_assets.py
git commit -m "Add desktop UI shell, tokens, bundled fonts and Home screens"
```

# Milestone 2 — The install flow

Deliverable: "Warm up the kitchen" runs a real install with live per-step rows, byte progress, and the restart and failure screens.

---

### Task 6: Step list → row model

**Files:**
- Modify: `host/desktop/view.py`
- Test: `tests/host/desktop/test_view_steps.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `host.core.install.Step`.
- Produces:
  - `STEP_LABELS: dict[str, str]` — moved verbatim from `host/setup_app/wizard.py::LABELS`.
  - `rows_for(steps: list[Step]) -> list[dict]` — one `{"name", "label", "progress"}` per step, in order.
  - `step_label(step: Step) -> str` — `step.label` when set, else `STEP_LABELS`, else `step.name`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/host/desktop/test_view_steps.py
"""The install panel's rows.

The design board is a macOS mock and shows seven. default_steps returns seven
on Lima and nine on WSL2, so a hard-coded seven puts "Step 4 of 7" on a
machine running nine steps and binds the progress bar to the wrong row.

Add `reset_install` to `host/desktop/api.py`:

        self._state.clear()

```python

### Task 13: Ports

  - `DesktopApi.list_ports() -> dict`, `.add_port(guest: int, host_port: int) -> dict`, `.remove_port(guest: int, host_port: int) -> dict`.

no clue why.

`_purge` removes the install directory, mirroring `cli.uninstall --purge`. Read `host/cli.py:336-373` and reuse its logic rather than reimplementing it; if the deletion is more than a couple of lines there, lift it into a `host/core/install.py` helper both call, so the CLI and the app cannot drift on what "purge" removes.

### Task 16: Relax `omelet up`'s compose guard

**Files:**
- Modify: `host/cli.py:164-180`
- Test: `tests/test_up_cli.py` (find the existing test covering the guard first: `grep -rn "no docker-compose" tests/`)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `omelet up` no longer refuses a folder without `docker-compose.yml`; it uploads and reports the agent's refusal as "imported, nothing to start yet".

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_up_without_a_compose_file_imports_and_says_so(tmp_path, capsys, monkeypatch):
    """The folder still lands in the VM; the coding agent writes the compose
    file later. Refusing here would refuse exactly the folders Import exists
    for."""
    from host.client import AgentError

    uploaded = []

    class FakeClient:
        def ensure_project(self, project_id, **kwargs):
            return {}

        def upload_directory(self, project_id, local_dir, **kwargs):
            uploaded.append(project_id)
            return {}

        def project_up(self, project_id):
            raise AgentError("no_compose", "no docker-compose.yml in project", 400)

    monkeypatch.setattr("host.cli._client", lambda: FakeClient())
    (tmp_path / "README.md").write_text("hello")

    from host.cli import up
    import typer
    try:
        up(str(tmp_path))
    except typer.Exit as exit_:
        code = exit_.exit_code
    else:
        code = 0

    out = capsys.readouterr()
    assert uploaded, "the folder should still have been imported"
    assert "nothing to start" in (out.out + out.err).lower()
    assert code == 0
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest tests/test_up_cli.py -q -k compose`
Expected: FAIL — the guard exits 1 before uploading.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

In `host/cli.py::up`, delete the `if not (local / COMPOSE_FILE).is_file():` block and its `COMPOSE_FILE` import, then wrap `project_up` so the agent's refusal reads as an outcome rather than an error:

```python
        client.ensure_project(project_id)
        client.upload_directory(project_id, local)
        if not (local / "docker-compose.yml").is_file():
            # No longer a refusal: a folder without one is a real import, and
            # the coding agent writes the compose file later. The upload above
            # already happened, so say what did happen rather than erroring.
            typer.echo(f"{project_id} was imported. There is no "
                       f"docker-compose.yml yet, so there is nothing to start.")
            return
        typer.echo(f"Starting {project_id} in the VM…")
```

Delete or update whichever existing test asserted the old refusal.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add host/cli.py tests/test_up_cli.py
git commit -m "Let omelet up import a folder without a compose file"
```

# Milestone 4 — Retire tkinter, package, document

Deliverable: the frozen binary on both platforms opens the new app; `host/setup_app/` is gone.

---

### Task 17: Retire `host/setup_app/`

**Files:**
- Delete: `host/setup_app/`, `tests/host/test_setup_app_logic.py`
- Modify: `host/cli.py:263-290`
- Test: `tests/host/desktop/test_no_tkinter.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
# tests/host/desktop/test_no_tkinter.py
"""tkinter is gone from the host.

Not tidiness: the macOS build required a tkinter-capable Python only because
of setup_app, and packaging/macos/build.sh still checks for one. An import
left behind would keep that requirement alive invisibly.
"""
from __future__ import annotations

import ast
from pathlib import Path

HOST = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3] / "host"


def test_no_host_module_imports_tkinter():
    files = sorted(HOST.rglob("*.py"))
    # A cwd-relative Path("host") passes vacuously from another directory;
    # this has bitten the repo three times.
    assert files, f"no host modules found under {HOST}"

    offenders = []
    for py in files:
        for node in ast.walk(ast.parse(py.read_text())):
            names = ([a.name for a in node.names] if isinstance(node, ast.Import)
                     else [node.module or ""] if isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom)
                     and node.level == 0 else [])
            if any(n == "tkinter" or n.startswith("tkinter.") for n in names):
                offenders.append(f"{py}:{node.lineno}")
    assert not offenders, f"host/ imported tkinter: {offenders}"


def test_setup_app_is_gone():
    assert not (HOST / "setup_app").exists()
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest tests/host/desktop/test_no_tkinter.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — `host/ imported tkinter: [...setup_app/app.py:12, ...]`

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```bash
git rm -r host/setup_app tests/host/test_setup_app_logic.py
```

In `host/cli.py::setup`, replace the tkinter branch:

```python
    if not headless:
        from host.desktop.__main__ import run
        provider.resume = resume
        raise typer.Exit(code=run(provider, state))
```

`run` builds its own `DesktopApi`, so `build_steps` must reach it. Pass it through: give `run` a `steps_factory=None` parameter forwarded to `DesktopApi(..., steps_factory=steps_factory)`, and have `cli.setup` call `run(provider, state, steps_factory=build_steps)`. Update `__main__.main()` to build the same factory (it already has `provider`, `root` and the constants `cli.setup` uses) so launching the app directly and launching it through `omelet setup` produce identical step lists.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`
Expected: PASS. The suite should now be ~530 tests minus the deleted setup_app ones, plus the new desktop ones, with **no** tkinter-related failures in this sandbox.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add -A host tests
git commit -m "Retire the tkinter setup app"
```

---

### Task 18: Dependencies and packaging

**Files:**
- Modify: `pyproject.toml`, `packaging/windows/omelet.spec`, `packaging/windows/installer.iss`, `packaging/windows/build.ps1`, `packaging/macos/omelet.spec`, `packaging/macos/setup_main.py`, `packaging/macos/build.sh`
- Test: extend `tests/host/test_host_dependencies.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/host/test_host_dependencies.py`:

```python
def test_the_webview_backends_are_platform_scoped():
    """pythonnet is Windows-only and pyobjc is macOS-only.

    Declared unconditionally, each would be installed and frozen into the
    other platform's binary, where it cannot even import.
    """
    import tomllib
    from pathlib import Path

    root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
    deps = tomllib.loads((root / "pyproject.toml").read_text())["project"]["dependencies"]
    by_name = {d.split(";")[0].split(">")[0].split("=")[0].strip().lower(): d
               for d in deps}

    assert "pywebview" in by_name
    assert "sys_platform" in by_name["pythonnet"]
    assert "sys_platform" in by_name["pyobjc-core"]


def test_the_ui_assets_are_bundled_by_both_specs():
    """A spec that freezes the code but not host/desktop/ui produces a binary
    that opens a window onto a missing file."""
    from pathlib import Path

    packaging = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] / "packaging"
    for spec in (packaging / "windows" / "omelet.spec",
                 packaging / "macos" / "omelet.spec"):
        assert "host/desktop/ui" in spec.read_text().replace("\\", "/"), spec
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest tests/host/test_host_dependencies.py -q`
Expected: FAIL — `KeyError: 'pythonnet'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

`pyproject.toml`:

```toml
# The host still parses no YAML and ships no web framework. pywebview is the
# window; its backend is the platform's own webview, and the two bindings
# below are how Python reaches each one. Scoped by marker so neither is
# frozen into the other platform's binary.
dependencies = [
    "typer>=0.12",
    "pywebview>=5.1",
    "pythonnet>=3.0; sys_platform == 'win32'",
    "pyobjc-core>=10.1; sys_platform == 'darwin'",
    "pyobjc-framework-Cocoa>=10.1; sys_platform == 'darwin'",
    "pyobjc-framework-WebKit>=10.1; sys_platform == 'darwin'",
]
```

Both `omelet.spec` files: add the UI tree to `datas` and the backend to `hiddenimports`:

```python
datas = [
    ("../../host/provision", "host/provision"),
    ("../../host/providers/omelet.yaml", "host/providers"),
    ("../../host/desktop/ui", "host/desktop/ui"),
]
hiddenimports = ["webview", "webview.platforms.edgechromium"]  # winforms on Windows
```

On macOS use `"webview.platforms.cocoa"`. Confirm the exact module names with `python3 -c "import webview.platforms; print(dir(webview.platforms))"` on each platform before committing; PyInstaller will not find them by static analysis.

`packaging/windows/installer.iss`: add the WebView2 bootstrapper to `[Files]` and `[Run]`:

```
[Files]
Source: "MicrosoftEdgeWebview2Setup.exe"; DestDir: "{tmp}"; Flags: deleteafterinstall

[Run]
; Evergreen, and a no-op when the runtime is already present -- which it is on
; Windows 11 and on updated Windows 10. Silent so the user sees one installer.
Filename: "{tmp}\MicrosoftEdgeWebview2Setup.exe"; Parameters: "/silent /install"; \
  StatusMsg: "Checking the Edge WebView2 runtime..."; Flags: waituntilterminated
```

`packaging/windows/build.ps1`: download the bootstrapper from
`https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703` into `packaging/windows/` before running ISCC.

`packaging/macos/build.sh`: delete the tkinter capability check. `packaging/macos/setup_main.py`: change the entrypoint import from `host.setup_app` to `host.desktop.__main__`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify a frozen build**

On Windows: `powershell packaging/windows/build.ps1`, then run the produced installer on a clean VM and confirm the app opens. On macOS: `bash packaging/macos/build.sh`, install the pkg, open Omelet. Both are out of reach from the WSL dev shell — record the result.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add pyproject.toml packaging tests/host/test_host_dependencies.py
git commit -m "Package the desktop app on both platforms"
```

---

### Task 19: Correct the docs

**Files:**
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Find every sentence the work falsified**

Run:

```bash
grep -n "typer\|tkinter\|setup_app\|Host runtime deps" CLAUDE.md
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Make the edits**

Three claims are now false and must change:

1. "The host's only runtime dependency is `typer`" → name `pywebview` and the two platform-scoped backends, and keep the reason the rule exists (the host is PyInstaller-frozen, so every declared dependency ships).
2. "The mac build needs a Python 3.12+ with tkinter" → the tkinter requirement is gone; the mac build is still native-arch only.
3. The sandbox-failures note listing `tests/host/test_setup_app_logic.py` → that file no longer exists; only the two `selfcheck` tests in `tests/test_setup_cli.py` still fail here.

Add one line to the architecture section recording that `host/desktop/` is the GUI and that `host/desktop/view.py` is where its logic lives, so the next reader does not go looking in `api.py`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify nothing else went stale**

Run: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) python3 -m pytest -q`
Expected: full suite passes apart from the two known `selfcheck` sandbox failures.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit and open the PR**

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Update CLAUDE.md for the desktop app"
git push -u origin feature/desktop-app
gh pr create --base main --title "Desktop app" --body "..."
```

Per the repo's git rules, run a code review by a separate agent after the PR is created.

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage** — every section maps to at least one task:

| Spec section | Tasks |
|---|---|
| 1. What this replaces | 17 |
| 2. Stack (pywebview, native chrome, OS theme) | 4, 5 |
| 3. Module layout, bridge, CSP, `_MEIPASS` | 1–5 |
| 4. Routes and readiness table | 1, 3, 5 |
| 5. Install flow, platform step counts, restart | 6, 7, 8, 9 |
| 6. Import / Ports / Doctor / repair / uninstall | 10–15 |
| `omelet up` consequence | 16 |
| 7. Deliberately inert (updates, project column) | 5 (`app_version` only), 15 (no Project column) |
| 8. Testing table | 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13 |
| 9. Packaging | 18 |
| 10. Risks (WebView2 fallback, accessibility, reduced motion) | 4, 5 |

**Gap found and closed inline:** the spec's "Check for updates" tile and the board's whole "Odds and ends" grid had no task — Home's templates rendered a version string and nothing else, so Import, Ports, Doctor, Uninstall and the update tile had no way in. Task 5 now carries the grid, the `updates-unavailable` template and its test; Task 15 now carries the `uninstall-confirm` template and a test that purge is not preselected.

**Placeholder scan:** no "TBD", "add error handling", or "similar to Task N". Two steps intentionally say *reuse the existing code* rather than reproducing it — Task 14 (`cli.uninstall`'s purge) and Task 16 (the existing guard test) — because copying those literals into the plan is exactly how the CLI and the app drift apart.

**Type consistency:** `route_for` → `(route, state)` used identically in Tasks 1, 3, 5. `rows_for` → `{"name", "label", "progress"}` produced in Task 6, consumed in Tasks 7 and 9. `emit(event: dict)` is the same callable in Tasks 2, 7, 12, 14. `on_progress(phase, done, total)` is the same signature in Tasks 10, 12, 15. `validate_port` → `""`/`"range"`/`"duplicate"`/`"reserved"` produced in Task 13, consumed by `PORT_REFUSALS` in Task 15 — all four keys present.
