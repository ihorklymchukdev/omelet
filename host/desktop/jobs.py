"""One slow thing at a time, off the thread that owns the window.

pywebview's `start()` blocks the main thread, so anything that takes longer
than a frame runs here and reports back through `push`. The shape is the
queue-and-thread one host/setup_app/wizard.py used, minus Tk's after() pump:
there, the UI drained a queue on a timer; here, the worker pushes.

Only one job runs at a time. Not a performance choice -- InstallState is a
JSON file, and two installs writing it would race.
