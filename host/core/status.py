"""Is this machine set up? Asked cheaply, and answered without raising.

The setup window calls `probe()` before it draws its first screen, to decide
whether to open on a status screen or run install. `host.client` is imported
lazily inside `probe()`, matching `host/core/install.py`: importing it at
module level would drag the HTTP client into every import of this module.

    Each stage has its own `try`, rather than one wrapping the whole function:
