"""Host-side constants.

Deliberately separate from `omelet_api/core/constants.py`: nothing under `host/`
may import `omelet_api/`. Names appearing in both modules are held equal by
`tests/test_constants_agree.py` -- that test, not a shared import, is what stops
the two copies drifting.

Guest paths are derived from GUEST_ROOT rather than spelled out, and the runtime
shell tests compare install.sh's literals against these names, so the host and
the runtime cannot end up pointing at different files.
