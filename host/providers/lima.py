# declared portForwards (39080, 39099) -- confirmed after the fact, not by a
# controlled session anyone recorded as it happened. See

# Still unrun anywhere: `forward()`/`forwards()` and the ssh control master
# they assume, `stop()`/`destroy()`, the uninstall path, whether
# omelet.yaml's `ssh.localPort` is honoured by Lima at all (the one VM
# inspected predates that field), the x86_64 image, and whether Rosetta is
