"""Why a started project still does not answer.

`classify()` only asks whether the containers stayed up. An app that listens on
127.0.0.1 inside its own container passes that check and is then unreachable
from anywhere else, so the URL answers a proxy error with nothing naming the
cause. This module is the only place in the system that can see both sides.
