# PyInstaller one-dir, wrapped in an .app bundle. The Windows twin builds two

# subsystem; here they differ in their entry script — the bundle's main
# executable has to default to the setup command, since Finder passes no
# arguments (see setup_main.py).

# Spec files are exec'd with PyInstaller's own namespace, which does not
# include the standard library.

# reappears. Every dest mirrors the repo path its reader resolves from __file__,
# so the bundle and a source checkout look identical.

# host.desktop is reached only through cli.setup()'s function-local import,
# so PyInstaller's static analysis never sees it -- a bundle missing one of
# these launches, shows a Dock icon, and dies on the first draw. webview and
# its platform backend are the same problem one layer down: pywebview picks
# its backend at runtime (`import webview.platforms.cocoa` inside the
# library, not a top-level import of ours), so PyInstaller's analysis never
# sees that either. cocoa is pywebview's macOS backend (WKWebView via pyobjc)
# -- unverified against an installed pywebview, since none is installed in
# this environment; confirm against the real package before a frozen build.
